    *
    * -> this algorithm is used to find out the minimum spanning tree of the graph
    *
    * in the minimum spanning tree - there should no cycles
    *
    *
    * idea :-
    *
    *       1. given the edgesin increasing order of their wights.
    *       2. initialize mst set and also res = 0;
    *       3. do the following for every edge tillmst count is v-1
    *           -> check if adding this edge to mst does not make a cycle
    *                   -> add to mst and add weight to res
    *
    *
    *
    *
    * Simple implementation :-
    *
    *       -> Create a mst graph ds and add each edge to it .
    *
    *               -> check if adding that edge does not cause a cycle , using cycle detetcing algorithm
