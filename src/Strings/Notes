-> String :-

        -> A sequence of characters.

        -> In Java every character uses utf-16

        -> Java uses - UTF - 16 (Unicode characters)  , 16 bit ,

        -> Ascii values :-  a - z (97 - 123)

                            A - Z ( 65 - 91)



        -> Strings in java :-

                -> String class - immutable

                -> StringBuffer class - mutable , Thread safe

                -> StringBuilder class - mutable , not thread safe




             Note :-  if you use String literals ("hello") then they will be allocated same memmory.


             -> String functions :-

                    -> Length

                    -> charAt

                    -> SubString

                    -> contains

                    -> equals

                    -> compareTo

                    -> indexOf





-> Overview of pattern searching porblems :-

        -> print all the indexes where the pattern matches - popular questions in this model


        -> comparing diff algorithms :-

                m -> pattern length
                n -> text length
                1 <= m <= n


        -> No Preprocessing :-

            -> Naive approach          - O((n-m+1)*m)

            -> Naive when all           - O(n)

               characters are distinct


        -> Preprocess Pattern :-

             -> Robin Karp : O((n-m+1)*m)  -  But better than naive on average

             -> KMP : O(n)

             -> Z algorithm -  simple implementation

             -> boys algorithm -


        ->  Preprocess Text

              -> Suffix tree : O(m)
