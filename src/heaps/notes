Binary Heap data Structure :-


        -> It is used for heapsort
        -> It is mainly used a priority queue

        -> Priotrity queue 2 types :-

                    -> min heap -> lowest value will have the highest priority

                    -> Max heap -> Hightest value will have the highest priority




        -> Binary Heap is a complete binary tree ( stored in  an array)

              -> complete binary tree means , all levels are filled except the last level and that too last level

                  is filled from left to right.



              -> to get index of left child  - 2*i + 1

                                 right child  -  2*i + 2

                                 parent    -  floor of (i-1)/2


                -> Advantages of stiring in array :-

                                   -> cache friendly ness
                                   -> fast access
                                   -> less memory storage
                                   -> min possible height





        -> Min heap :-

                -> it is a complete binary tree in which every node is smaller than its descendents

                -> Note it is stored in a array
